to improve H/M (maximize hit count, minimize miss count),

We can request the same page reference several times in a row.
3 page frames (example): 11111-> 5 hits, 1 miss 1


We can request as many distinct references as possible with as few repeats as feasible to reduce H/M (minimize hit count, maximum miss count).
3 page frames (example):  1 2 3 4 5 6 this leads to 6 misses and 0 hits
