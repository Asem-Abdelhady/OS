we have 16 bits as a virtual address.
page frame = 8KB = 8192 bytes.

1 virtual address in the page table entry = frame number + page number.

1 page frame = 2^13 addresses.

13 bits available for frame number.

3 bits are left from the virtual address.

For the page number we will end up with 2^3 entries.
